Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and
**Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML
for a page.

# Title 1

## Title 2

### Title 3

#### Title 4

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build
  time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request. - **Server-side Rendering**
  is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
