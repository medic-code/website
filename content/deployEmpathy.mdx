Deploy Empathy is a book that gives a practical guide to user interviewing for anyone who needs tactical information to get the most out of users. User interviewing as a tool requires less time than you think and has flexible utility ranging from helping achieve product-market fit to understanding what to build next.

Below I outline the key concepts to take away from the book to help do user interviews better.

# Key Concepts

## Empathy is a skill

Empathy is the ability to validate someone else's feelings even when that person's opinion is different from yours.

It requires withholding judgement and validating other people's feelings/thought processes. It is not something people innately have, but anyone can learn.

Let's take a concrete example. We can illustrate the differences between sympathetic, empathetic and solution-based responses to understand how empathy differs.

For example, you ask your friend the following

Q: How was your day?  
A: “Work was a tough, busy day today and to top it off my boss yelled at me!”

How would you respond?

**Potential responses**

1. I’m so sorry to hear that, how awful! (Sympathetic)
2. Did you try telling your boss that it was rude? (Solution focused)
3. That really hurt you (Empathy)

Which one of these will help you have better insight into what's going on? If you sit and think about it the sympathetic and solution-focused responses do not allow others to expand their thinking and feelings.

The power of validating another person's feelings means they are more likely to open up. You can gain insights you would never know by validating their feelings.

The same can be used when speaking to users, you can gain insights into complicated processes to understand the goals they want to achieve.

## Everything is a process

The next time you speak to a friend, ask them to talk you through making a cup of coffee. Ask five friends you will start to see everyone has a different way of making it and context as to why they do.

The process appears simple but often requires multiple steps and tools to complete the goal. If you think about it, you can start to see that almost everything we do is a process ranging from simple to very complicated.

## Processes have context

If you speak to people about processes you will realise that everything in your life is a process full of little tasks with feelings and context. In 'Deploy Empathy' this is broken down into three different components that can affect each step or at a process level.

1. Functional (the steps to take in a process)
2. Social (How social factors affect doing a step/process)
3. Emotional (The way a step/process makes you feel)

For example, coffee making. Here is a list of how I make coffee (please excuse the list length!)

1. Take the beans out of the coffee container
2. Weigh out 16 grams of beans using the grinder container
3. Put the coffee into the Aeropress
4. Boil the kettle with enough water for a cup
5. Pour water into the Aeropress
6. Rotate the Aeropress to mix the water and coffee for a few seconds
7. Put the Aeropress onto the cup
8. Press down on the plunger to extract the coffee

The steps to make a cup of coffee can be very detailed or very simple. But what about the social aspects? I like to make coffee with my partner and share that with her - a social context. I take a lot of time making a good cup of coffee and use a good grinder to get the most flavour out of the beans - an emotional context.

I haven't begun to dig into this process, but you can see the goal of making a cup of coffee can be more detailed than you think. However, it is only just that. The motivation is within the social and the emotional. If we want to get the most out of a process, we have to dive into that at a step and process level.

Mapping out each step and determining the emotional and social context helps you understand the problem.

## Five interviews are enough?

In Deploy Empathy, the book discusses how many interviews should be enough to gain the most insights. A good yardstick is that if you see repeated answers in your interviews, you have done enough. Michele recommends starting with five interviews.

Moreover, five interviews can, with a well-defined scope get you over 80% of the insights you need. This come from [research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/) in usability testing by Tom Landauer and Jacob Nielsen of the Nielson Norman group.

They found that the usability problems discovered with each new user testing map showed a logarithmic growth (quickly increases but diminishes after a certain number).

By the 5th user, you've wasted time and will want to make changes and do extra cycles of 5 users.

Doing five user interviews and assessing allows you to gain the most whilst still being able to pause whether further rounds are needed.

## Empathy tactics

Some of these tactics below in getting the most out of users will be familiar to doctors. The idea behind them is about validation and not.

Aim in the interviews for the users to do 90% of the talking (This can be difficult for people who love to talk!)

1. Use validating statements - avoid giving your own opinion
   - "That makes sense"
   - "I can see where you're coming from with that"
   - "I can see why you would do it that way"
   - "Can you walk me through that context"
2. Mirroring - Repeating back what the person has said
3. Summarising - Concisely repeat back in a summary of what a user has said to generate feedback
4. Summarising with slightly wrong step - Encourages the user to correct and expand
5. Checking the rationale of a step in a process when you already know the answer
6. Pausing - Using a pause on an open question can help users just collect their thoughts

These tactics help you stop yourself from giving your own opinions and solutions and encourage those you speak to expand and clarify their goals and frustrations.

## Focus on pain and frequency

In a previous concept, we discussed the idea of context. Whilst this is important, it won't tell us whether these problems are worth solving.

To understand this, you need to know the timeline in more depth. What is the length of each step? Are they using any tools? How much are they paying for the tools currently? What are their feelings about the tools used?

Knowing the frequency and sense of the pain of the process/steps means you can plot it on a matrix.

By understanding pain and frequency you can see that those with high pain and high frequency are things that are worth thinking about solving.

Users can tell you how useful or valuable a solution may be to a problem. They won't be able to tell you whether it is viable or feasible. That is, can it be solved? Can your team solve this?

## Pick the themes

Doing five interviews gives you enough knowledge on how where to go. Read the transcripts, sit on them, and think about the themes. The themes will help you understand the problem better. Use the social and emotional context to think about the next set of actions.

This might be removing problems, and creating tickets on a roadmap. You may go to the user with a list of problems from these interviews to understand the importance and satisfaction.

These actions might be marketing-related, using words and phrases by the user to allow you to gain more users. It might reveal better use cases that you may not have thought of.

## Summary of concepts

1. Empathy is a skill that you can learn
2. Everything is a process
3. Processes and steps have functional, social and emotional context
4. User Interviews are one tool and five interviews can give you the majority of insights
5. Aim for the interviewee to talk the vast majority of the time
6. The pain frequency matrix contextualises the problem's worth
7. Speak to 5 people
8. Pick out the themes to create actions

## Final thoughts

The book sets out to plug a gap in the literature between books that discuss and evangelises talking to users. The focus is set and does a good job in written form to give the reader a framework.

It is just the start like all skills, you need real-world experience to get better at it.
