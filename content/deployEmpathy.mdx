Deploying Empathy gives a practical guide to user interviewing for anyone who needs tactical information to get the most out of users. User interviewing as a tool requires less time than you think and has flexible utility ranging from helping achieve product-market fit to understanding what to build next.

# Key Concepts

## Empathy is a Skill

Empathy is the ability to validate someone else's feelings even when that person's opinion is different from yours.

Empathy requires withholding judgement and validating other people's feelings/thought processes. Empathy is not something people innately have, but anyone can learn.

Empathy gets used a lot in healthcare and life. Let's take an example to illustrate the differences between sympathetic, empathetic and solution-based responses.

For example, you ask your friend the following

Q: How was your day?  
A: “Work was a tough, busy day today and to top it off my boss yelled at me!”

How would you respond?

**Potential responses**

1. I’m so sorry to hear that, how awful! (Sympathetic)
2. Did you try telling your boss that it was rude? (Solution focused)
3. That really hurt you (Empathy)

Which one of these will help you have better insight? If you sit and think about it, sympathetic and solution-focused responses do not allow others to expand their thinking. The power of validating another person's feelings means they will open up for you. You can gain insights into complicated processes beyond the individual steps.

## Everything is a Process

The next time you speak to a friend, ask them to talk you through making a cup of coffee. Ask five friends you will start to see everyone has a different way of making it and context as to why they do.

The process appears simple but often requires multiple steps and tools to complete the goal. You can start to see that almost everything we do is a process ranging from simple to very complicated.

## Processes have context

You will realise that everything in your life is a process full of little tasks with feelings and context. In 'Deploy Empathy' breaks this down into three different components that can affect each step or at a process level.

1. Functional (the steps to take)
2. Social (How social factors affect doing a step/process)
3. Emotional (The way a step/process makes you feel)

For example, coffee making. Here is a list of how I make coffee (please excuse the list length!)

1. Take the beans out of the coffee container
2. Weigh out 16 grams of beans using the grinder container
3. Grind the beans with a handheld grinder
   1. Making a decision on the grind setting based on the last time
4. Set up the coffee mat on the table
5. Put the coffee distributor on the mat
6. Put ground coffee near the coffee mat
7. Put tamp near the coffee mat
8. Take the handheld espresso machine out
9. Pour water into the kettle and boil
10. Preheat the portafilter with hot water
11. Flush hot water through the handheld espresso machine
12. Take portafilter out of hot water and put ground coffee in
13. Distribute the grains in the portafilter
14. Tamp down grounds
15. Attach to the espresso machine
16. Fill the top of the espresso machine with boiling water
17. Distribute water into the portafilter for 10 seconds
18. Put the coffee scale under the espresso machine
19. Put the coffee cup on the scales
20. Tare the scales and start the timer on the scale
21. Pull the lever down to extract the coffee
22. Watch for the weight to reach 30grams in the cup
23. Take out of espresso machine
24. Add around 50-80mls of water
25. Enjoy the taste!

The steps to make a cup of coffee can be very detailed or very simple. But what about the social aspects? I like to make coffee with my partner and share that with her - a social context. I take a lot of time making a good cup of coffee and use a good grinder to get the most flavour out of the beans - A emotional context.

I haven't begun to dig into this process, but you can see a list of steps that can be made more detailed than you think. However, it is only just that. The motivation is within the social and the emotional. If we want to get the most out of a process, we have to dive into that at a step and process level.

Mapping out each step and determining the emotional and social context helps you understand the problem.

## How many Interviews?

The book discusses how many interviews should be enough. A good yardstick is that if you see repeated answers, you have done enough. Michele recommends starting with five interviews.

Moreover, five interviews can, in a well-defined scope get you over 80% of the insights you need. This insight has been extrapolated from some [research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/) in usability testing done by Tom Landauer and Jacob Nielsen of Nielson Norman group.

They found that the usability problems discovered with each new user testing map showed a logarithmic growth (quickly increases but diminishes after a certain number).

By the 5th user, you've wasted time and will want to make changes and do extra cycles of 5 users.

Doing five user interviews and assessing allows you to gain the most whilst still being able to pause whether further rounds are needed.

## Tactical concepts for Empathy

Some of these tactics in getting the most out of users will be familiar to doctors but slightly framed differently. The idea behind them is about validation and not.

Aim in the interviews for the users to do 90% of the talking (This can be difficult for people who love to talk!)

1. Validating statements
   - "That makes sense"
   - I can see where you're coming from with that
   - I can see why you would do it that way
   - "Can you walk me through that context"
2. Mirroring - Repeating back what the person has said
3. Summarising - Summarising what a user has said to generate feedback
4. Summarising with slightly wrong step - Encourages the user to correct and expand
5. Checking the rationale of a step in a process when you already know the answer
6. Pausing - Using a pause on an open question can help users just collect their thoughts

## What is a problem worth?

In a previous concept, we discussed the idea of context. Whilst this is important, it won't tell us whether these problems are worth solving.

To understand this, you need to know the timeline in more depth. What is the length of each step? Are they using any tools? How much are they paying for the tools currently? What are your feelings about the tools used?

Knowing the frequency and sense of the pain of the process/steps means you can plot it on a matrix.

By understanding pain and frequency you can see that those with high pain and high frequency are things that are worth thinking about solving.

Users can tell you how useful or valuable a solution may be to a problem. They won't be able to tell you whether it is viable or feasible. That is, can it be solved? Can your team solve this?

## Analyse

Doing five interviews gives you enough knowledge on how where to go. Read the transcripts, sit on them, and think about the themes. Use the social and emotional context to think about the next set of actions. This might be removing problems, and creating tickets on a roadmap. You may go to the user with a list of problems from these interviews to understand the importance and satisfaction.

These actions might be marketing-related, using words and phrases by the user to allow you to gain more users. It might reveal better use cases that you may not have thought of.

## Summary of concepts

1. Empathy is a skill that you can learn
2. Everything is a process
3. Processes and steps have functional, social and emotional context
4. User Interviews are one tool and five interviews can give you the majority of insights
5. The aim for the interviewee to talk the vast majority of the time
6. Pain Frequency matrix contextualises the problem's worth

## Final thoughts

The book sets out to plug a gap in the literature between books that discuss and evangelises talking to users. The focus is set and does a good job in written form to give the reader a framework.

It is just the start like all skills, you need real-world experience to get better at it.
